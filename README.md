🌮 TACO-licious Point of Sale System
A console-based ordering application that lets customers fully customize tacos, add drinks and sides, and automatically generate a neatly formatted receipt for every order.
📌 Overview

TACO-licious is a point-of-sale system built to modernize and streamline the ordering workflow at a taco shop. Instead of handwritten orders or confusing verbal communication, customers are guided interactively through each step of building a complete, accurate order.

The system walks the user through customizing tacos, selecting sides and drinks, reviewing the full order, and finalizing the purchase. All receipts are saved to disk using a timestamp-based filename for easy organization.

This project highlights Object-Oriented Programming, clean separation of responsibilities, and a modular, extensible design that aligns with the assignment’s technical requirements.
